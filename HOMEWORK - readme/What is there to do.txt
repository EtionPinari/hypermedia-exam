IMPORTANT:
	The main div that contains all content should be called class = "container"
	FOR THE DATABASE TO WORK, PLEASE CREATE A NEW FILE IN THE FOLDER /server CALLED 'personalDB.js'. IN THIS FILE WRITE THE FOLLOWING CODE: 
		export const databasePassword = 'yourPassword'
	We can focus first on the content and lastly on the css. Let's define firstly the components
	Try putting <style scoped> everywhere except for the layout/default.vue so we do not have css rules that conflict.
	In ~/assets/scss/colors.scss there are two (random and to be changed) colors which we could use in css rules so they can be consistent throughout all the website.
		To use them just type in your css rule "   .my-class { background-color : $main-bg-color}  ". We will have one point of entrance to change all colors of the website if we want.
